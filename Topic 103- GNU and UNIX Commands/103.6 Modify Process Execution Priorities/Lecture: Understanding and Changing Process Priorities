*Process Priorities
-All processes need to use CPU time
-Priority assignment dictates how much time the CPU grants the process
-Process priority(nice level) ranges from:
  () -20 = Highest Priority
  () 19  = Lowest Priority
  () 0 = Default for most processses

-Only root(or a privileged account) can lower the nice value(giving higher priority) of a process
