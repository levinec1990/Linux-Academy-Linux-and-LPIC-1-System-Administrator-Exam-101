*Standard Output

-All Unix-like operating systems have something like a bucket where all output goes
-The bucket is called Standard Output
-Abbreviated as 'stdout'

*Redirecting Standard Output
-We can use special characters to intercept information before it gets to 'stdout'
-Characters: > and >>

*Standard Input
-Input into a process or application usually comes from entries made on the keyboard
-Files and standard output from other commands can provide input to another command
-Special characters: < and |
-Abbreviated as 'stdin'
-Examples
  ()wc test.sh      =input comes from keyboard
  ()wc < test.sh    =input comes from file 
  ()cat /etc/passwd | less = input comes from stdout of cat command
  
*Standard Error
-Abreviated as 'stderr'
-Typically written to the screen
-Standard Error has a 'file handle' number associated with it: 2
  ()stdin also has a number: 0
  ()stout also has a number: 1
  
-Redirecting all the things:
  ()internet-toaster.sh   (stderr goes to screen)
  ()internet-toaster.sh 2> error.log  (stderr gets redirected to error.log file)
  ()internet-toaster.sh 2>&1 | less   (stderr and stdout gets sent as stdin to the less command)
