*upstart background

First developed for Ubuntu in 2006
First used in Ubuntu 6.10
Eventually used in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, Debian, and Fedora 9
Unlike init, upstart offers asynchronous starting of services - decreasing boot up times
Works off of real-time events, which init was not designed to understand
Upstart not only stop and start services but monitors their availability as well

*init boot sequence 
/sbin/init -> /etc/inittab -> /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit -> /etc/rc.d/rcX.d (in sequential order) -> Login

*upstart boot sequence
/sbin/init -> startup(7) -> mountall(8)
                    |-> /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf -> telinit(8) -> runlevel(7) -> /etc/init/rc.conf -> Login

*upstart Service Monitoring
-init is static, it does not natively respond to changes on a system

-upstart is dynamic, it can respond to changes on the system

-A change on a Linux system is an event

-Events trigger jobs

-Jobs have two categories
tasks
services

*Job states
Waiting -> starting -> running -> stopping -> killed -> post-stop -> waiting
