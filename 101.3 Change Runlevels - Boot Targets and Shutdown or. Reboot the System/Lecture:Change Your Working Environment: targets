*Purpose of a systemd Target*
-A target is a unit that syncs up with other units when the computer boots or changes states
-Often used to bring the system to a new state:
  -i.e a state with just a command line: multi-user.target
  -i.e a state with a desktop enviroment: graphical.target
-Other units associate themselves with a target for an operating enviroment

*Types of Targets
-multi-user.target: Multi-user target similiar to runlevel 3
-graphical.target: Multi-user system with a desktop enviroment similar to runlevel 5
-rescue.target: Pulls in a basic system and file system mounts and provides a rescue shell
-basic.target: basic system, used during the boot process before another target takes over
-sysint.target: system initialization

*Target Units
$ systemctl list-unit-files -t target 
Shows all unit files for available targets

$ systemctl -list-units -t target 
Show all active and loaded unit files

$systemctl get-default
List out the default target

$systemctl set-defult
Change the default target to a different target

*Changing Targets
$systemctl isolate <target> 
Changes the running state of a system to a different target than is running

$systemctl rescue 
Almost identical to System V Init single-user mode, allows the root user to repair system

$systemctl reboot
Will run the reboot.target. Same as running command reboot

$systemctl poweroff
Will run the poweroff.target. Same as typing poweroff
