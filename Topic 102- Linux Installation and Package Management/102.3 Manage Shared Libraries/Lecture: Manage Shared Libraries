*What is a Shared Library
- Files containing functionality that other applications can use
- These files end in a '.so' extension , for 'shared object'
- Found in the following locations on a Linux system
  () /lib
  () /usr/lib (for 32 bit systems and /usr/lib64 (for 64 bit systems)
  () /usr/local/lib
  () /usr/share
  
- Two types of library files:
  () Dynamic (end in .so)
  () Statically linked (end in .a)
