* The Debian Package Utility
- The .deb package contains:
  () application or utility
  () default configuration files
  () how and where to install the files that come with the package
  () listing of dependencies the package requires
  
- Dependencies need to already be installed, or installed with the package
  () apt handles dependencies for you, dpkg does not
