- Partition size limited to 2TB

GPT(GUID Partition Table):

- Needs UEFI(Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) to boot:
  () Replacement for traditional BIOS, can act in legacy BIOS mode
  () Requires a 64 bit operating system
  () Prevents unauthorized operating systems from booting on the system
