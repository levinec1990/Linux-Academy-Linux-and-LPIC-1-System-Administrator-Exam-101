* The Main File System Locations
Primary locations that you must know
- / bottom of the directory tree, 'the root'
- /var: The variable location, log files, and dynamic content(such as web sites) are often found here
- /home: The users home directory, where personal files are stored
- /boot: The boot directory, where the linux kernel and supporting files are stored
- /opt: Location used for "optional" software, often used by third party vendors. Enterprise enviorments use this location often

* Swap Space
Swap is temporary storage that acts like RAM:
- When a percentage of RAM is full, the kernel will move less used data to swap
- Swap partition(Most common setup)
- Swap file(Similar to the page file on a Windows system)
  () Much slower performance than using a dedicated partition 
  
- Sizing
  () Older rule of thumb ranged from 1.5X to 2.0X the size of your available RAM
  () Now, no less than 50% of available RAM
