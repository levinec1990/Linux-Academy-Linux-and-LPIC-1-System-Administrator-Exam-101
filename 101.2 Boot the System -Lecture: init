init - short for 'initialization'
Based off of the System V init used in UNIX systems
Services are started one after the other in a serial fashion.

*init startup

initab

/etc/initab

<identifier>:<runlevel>:<action>:<process>

id3:initdefault:

id = identifier
3 = run level
initdefault = action
process = Empty

si::sysinit:/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit

id = si
no runlevel(As there is no number)
action = sysinit
process = /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit

Each line specifies a runlevel

10:0:wait:/etc/rc.d/rc 0

wait - The proces specified will be started once when the runlevel is entered, and init will wait for its termination

*The boot process

1)Boot Partition found
2)Kernel and initial RAM disk are loaded
3)Kernel pull initial drivers and set up tools from RAM disk
4)The kernel hand the system over to /sbin/init
5)init performs some system maintenance from /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit
6)init has read the initdefault line in /etc/initab, and is entering runlevel3
7)Now the system is ready for use

Red Hat based: /etc/rc.d
Debian based: /etc/init.d

rc = run commands

rc0.d = runlevel 0
rc1.1 = runlevel 1

rc.sysinit = Script that does housecleaning before entering its runlevel
rc.local = Run after the run level is completing loaded

ls /etc/rc.d/rc3/d

K01dnsmasq
S08mcstrans

These are symbolic links back to the /etc/init.d
Begin with K = Services that are to be killed
Begin with S = These services are to be started

Numbers indicate the loading process
S08ip6tables This is loading first
S08iptables  Next up
S10network

/etc/init.d - contains the scripts for the services on the system

/etc/init.d/rc - script that orchestrates how the runlevel scripts run and what occurs when a runlevel changes
